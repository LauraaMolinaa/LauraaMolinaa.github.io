I am a third-year computer science student at John Abbott College, passionate about technology and problem-solving. Over the course of my studies, I have developed strong skills in programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML/CSS, SQL, and Bash. I am proud to have been awarded two FORTES scholarships, which supports and recognizes women making strides in the technology industry.

Teamwork has been a key part of my learning journey. Participating in various team projects has allowed me to build strong collaboration skills, share ideas openly, and work towards common goals. These experiences have shaped me into a reliable team player who values clear communication, active listening, and finding effective solutions to challenges.

I am known for my hardworking attitude, positive mindset, and willingness to take on challenges. With excellent communication skills and a friendly demeanor, I aim to create a productive and welcoming environment wherever I work. I am excited to continue learning and growing as I contribute to the tech industry.
